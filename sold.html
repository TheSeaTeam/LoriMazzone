                    designed to keep maintenance and energy costs at a minimum. A block and stucco exterior surrounds
                    low-E glass double pane vinyl windows and hot water is supplied by a tankless gas heater. Earth-tone
                    tiling through common areas, including baths and laundry add an additional level of easy maintenance
                    for the homeowner. Flush mount ceiling fans, neutral wall colors and high ceilings add eye pleasing
                    decor that can readily be adapted to your personal style. Every home needs a master suite that
                    offers serenity and privacy. This 14'x16' suite features a full bath with walk-in closet, step-in

                    greenery giving home a picture postcard charm. Additionally, vinyl fencing keeps the kiddos and pets
                    enclosed for security on the oversized level lot.</p>
